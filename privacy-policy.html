  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 25, 2025</p>
  <p>This app is a personal tool developed to automate email processing using the Gmail API. It is used solely by the developer and is not shared with other users.</p>

  <h2>What data do we access?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Email metadata (e.g., sender, subject, labels)</li>
    <li>Email message content (if needed for automation)</li>
    <li>Labels and message IDs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why do we access this data?</h2>
  <p>We use the Gmail API in read-only mode to extract specific content from certain emails â€” such as verification links or temporary codes (e.g., TOTP). This helps automate personal workflows like logging in to services or verifying identity during development or testing.</p>

  <h2>Do we share your data?</h2>
  <p>No. All access is limited to the authenticated user (your own Gmail account). No data is shared with third parties or stored externally.</p>

  <h2>How is your data stored?</h2>
  <p>Data is temporarily processed during automation and is not saved or logged to any external storage.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For any questions, please contact the developer at your.email@example.com.</p>
