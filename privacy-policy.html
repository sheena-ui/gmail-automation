  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 30, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the application <strong>gmail-api-client</strong>, a personal tool created to automate Gmail inbox reading tasks using the Gmail API in read-only mode. It is used solely by the developer and not shared with any other users.</p>

  <h2>What data do we access?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Email metadata (e.g., sender, subject, timestamps)</li>
    <li>Email message body (text content only, no attachments)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why do we access this data?</h2>
  <p>The application accesses Gmail messages for the purpose of extracting verification codes (such as MFA or TOTP) from specific email subjects. This helps automate login and identity verification steps during development or testing.</p>

  <h2>Do we share your data?</h2>
  <p>No. All data access is limited to the developer's personal Gmail account. No email content is logged, stored, or transmitted to third parties.</p>

  <h2>How is your data stored?</h2>
  <p>No data is persistently stored. The application runs locally, processes data in-memory, and terminates after completing its task.</p>
