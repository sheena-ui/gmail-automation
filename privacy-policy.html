  <h1>Privacy Policy for Inbox Extractor</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 6th, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the application <strong>Inbox Extractor</strong> handles your information when using Google services.</p>

  <h2>App Overview</h2>
  <p>Inbox Extractor is a personal tool that uses the <strong>Gmail API</strong> to access email messages in the developer’s own Gmail account. The app is intended to automate the process of extracting verification codes and links from incoming emails for personal use.</p>

  <h2>What Google user data is accessed?</h2>
  <p>The app requests access to Gmail data via the Gmail API in read-only mode. Specifically, it accesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email metadata (e.g., sender, subject, timestamps)</li>
    <li>The message body text of emails</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why is this data accessed?</h2>
  <p>The app reads Gmail messages to extract verification codes or links used in multi-factor authentication (MFA) or login flows. This is done to support automation tasks during development and testing.</p>

  <h2>Is any data stored or shared?</h2>
  <p>No. The application does not store, log, or transmit any Gmail content to third parties. All processing is done locally in memory, and no data is written to disk or sent externally.</p>

  <h2>Who has access to the data?</h2>
  <p>Only the authorized user (the developer) has access to Gmail content through this application. The app does not support multiple users or accounts.</p>

  <h2>Security Measures</h2>
  <p>The application uses Google's secure OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. The user explicitly grants consent to Gmail read-only access, and the app only uses the access token provided by Google to perform read operations.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns about this policy, please contact: <strong>sheena.lu@ui.com</strong> or <strong>uissosqa@gmail.com</strong></p>
