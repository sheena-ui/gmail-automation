# Privacy Policy

** Last Updated: April 25, 2025**

This app is a personal tool developed to automate email processing using the Gmail API. It is used solely by the
developer and is not shared with other users.

## What data do we access?

- Email metadata (e.g., sender, subject, labels)
- Email message content (if needed for automation)
- Labels and message IDs

## Why do we access this data?

We use the Gmail API in read-only mode to extract specific content from certain emails â€” such as verification links or
temporary codes (e.g., TOTP). This helps automate personal workflows like logging in to services or verifying identity
during development or testing.

## Do we share your data?

No. All access is limited to the authenticated user (your own Gmail account). No data is shared with third parties or
stored externally.

## How is your data stored?

Data is temporarily processed during automation and is not saved or logged to any external storage.
